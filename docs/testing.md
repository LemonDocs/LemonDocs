# Testing
---
ðŸ¤¯Testing your documentation is quite easy, as it only takes **less than 5 minutes** to do.

ðŸ’¡ You will need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" style="text-decoration: none;">**Python**</a> for this.

ðŸ’» To host/run your documentation locally, run this command:
```shell
$ python server.py
```

ðŸ”§ This should appear in your terminal:
```Terminal
Serving LemonDocs at http://localhost:8000
```
 After that, go to **http://localhost:8000**<br>
You should see your **documentation** there.
